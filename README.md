# Unix_Epoch_Counter
Purpose of this Unix Epoch Counter is to celebrate 1.5 Billion Unix Epoch and other Timestamps.

This Python script contains a function called unix_countup() in [unix_periods](https://github.com/vdatasci/Unix_Epoch_Counter/blob/master/unix_period.py), which counts up to a unix time.

According to Wikipedia, [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) (also known as POSIX time or epoch time) is a system for describing instants in time, defined as the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970, minus the number of leap seconds that have taken place since then.


## Setup:
* Open Command Prompt
* Change directory (cd) to the location of [unix_counter.py](https://github.com/vdatasci/Unix_Epoch_Counter/blob/master/unix_counter.py)
